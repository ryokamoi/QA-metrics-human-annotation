        "article": "Hector Bellerin is fast becoming seen by fans, and possibly even by his manager, as Arsenal's premier right back, after impressing in the absence of Mathieu Debuchy. The young Spaniard scored his second Premier League goal, cutting inside and curling left-footed past Simon Mignolet, in the 4-1 win over Liverpool last weekend, and is developing a reputation as a player capable of becoming a top-level full back. But, it seems, in the dressing room, it is his status as the club's premier sprinter, rather than as a defender, that is most in question, after he beat Theo Walcott's 40 metre club sprint record last summer. Hector Bellerin scored a brilliant goal to put Arsenal ahead against Liverpool last weekend at the Emirates. Bellerin has emerged as a star player after filling in for the injured Mathieu Debuchy at right back this season. 'We were just having a test and then they told me I was the fastest at the club,' Bellerin told The Telegraph. 'I did not beat it by that much. There was a bit of banter and he is trying to beat me now.' Bellerin shaved a hundredth of a second off Walcott's time, prompting the 26-year-old winger to vow to reclaim his title at the end of the season. . And since then he has gone on to establish himself as a right-back of some promise, progressing well beyond Arsene Wenger's expectations.  . 'I am happy that now, after not so good performances in the beginning, the coach has still put confidence in me and given me minutes. . Bellerin has exceptional pace, as he proved in August when he set a new Arsenal record over 40 metres. Theo Walcott had previously held the record, but Bellerin shaved one hundredth of a second off his time. But Walcott is determined to take his record back from Bellerin this summer and be speed king again. 'The chances always come through injuries, which is not a nice thing. Now we are going to have Debuchy back and I am happy for him, but when you get your chance, you need to do the best you can. I have done my best to take this opportunity.' With Debuchy on the verge of match fitness, Bellerin will soon find out whether he has done enough to grab that opportunity. . But after his brilliant goal at the Emirates stadium last weekend, one thing is for certain - he is no longer known just for being quick over 40 metres.  .",

        "article": "Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho will persist with struggling midfield trio Cesc Fabregas, Nemanja Matic and Oscar as he refuses to shuffle his squad so late in the season. Mourinho had to answer questions about his three midfielders after the hard-fought 2-1 home win over Stoke. Asked whether Oscar is struggling, as he was substituted at half-time, Mourinho said: \u2018No, I don\u2019t think he had a bad performance, I just think he was not good enough, which is a huge difference. . Oscar tries a flick that doesn't come off during a disappointing display against Stoke on Saturday. Jose Mourinho insists he will stick by his players despite the three midfielders' decline in form recently. Cesc Fabregas runs with the ball, but the assists have dried up for the Spanish international in recent weeks. \u2018For me football is not just mathematics. When some people write that Fabregas drops his level because the number of assists are not the same, the number of assists are probably not the same because the player that he assists does not score.\u2019. \u2018Matic, he was suspended, and after the suspension he was injured celebrating in the final, so he went back and he was not in the best condition. \u2018I always think stability is very important in a team, and it\u2019s not in April that you are going to make important changes.\u2019. Eden Hazard was Chelsea's best player, scoring a penalty before Charlie Adam stunned the hosts with an equaliser from his own half. Loic Remy sealed the points, after Hazard laid the chance on a plate for him, and kept the Blues in command at the top of the table. . Oscar was withdrawn at half time but his manager insisted he was not struggling and will bounce back. Nemanja Matic holds off a tackle in midfield, but even the defensive midfielder has been short of his best.  .",

        "article": "On Thursday, NPR -- headquartered in Washington, just 40 miles away from Baltimore -- ran its latest update on the urban turmoil that has erupted in the wake of the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray because of still-unexplained spinal injuries that occurred while he was under police custody. Unfortunately, while it was a freshly produced segment, it was hardly a new story. Titled \"Baltimore Unrest Reveals Tensions Between African-Americans And Asians,\" the five-minute piece is urgently introduced with the promise that it will reveal \"what's really happening in the more troubled neighborhoods of this majority black city,\" going on state that a key ingredient of the unrest was African-Americans \"targeting Asian-owned businesses for destruction.\" A similar claim was made after Ferguson's uprising in August of last year. Indeed, it has been a toxic feature of the coverage of many episodes of mass metropolitan violence since the late 1980s, the era during which the trope of widespread hostility between Asian and black communities first took root in the media consciousness. Yes, interethnic tensions continue to exist, though they are hardly limited to Asians and blacks. And yes, this has resulted in troubling incidents and tragedies on both sides. But while reports say that during the chaotic social breakdowns of the past year, black-owned businesses were mostly protected during bouts of violence, there's little evidence to suggest a pattern in which Asian businesses have been actively targeted out of racial animus. Instead, it seems as if Asian-owned stores have experienced damage partly because they make up a portion of establishments operating in the most economically vulnerable and socially volatile of neighborhoods. In other words, they were collateral damage, along with other stores in the vicinity of riots. So it's time to call this persistent meme what it is: A misleading, hyperbolic and dangerous distraction, one that shifts blame away from the real issues. As Jennifer Lee, sociology professor at University of California, Irvine, and author of the 2002 book \"Civility in the City: Blacks, Jews and Koreans in Urban America,\" notes, \"the mainstream media continues to pit minority groups against one another to draw attention from larger structural problems that plague poor, disadvantaged communities. By directing our attention to interminority conflict, it directs blame away from the structures that perpetuate gross inequality and toward individual problems.\" Let's be honest. There were then -- and still are -- legitimate issues that exist between immigrant storeowners and the largely African American customers they serve that are rooted in extensive cultural differences. There's no denying that friction exists in the daily transaction between embattled communities trying hard to coexist under economic and social pressures. For example, in 1993, the robbery and shooting of Joel Lee, a 21-year-old Korean American at Towson State University, and the subsequent acquittal of his killer, was a point of contention between the Korean and African American communities. But things are different now. Decades after the height of media-inflamed tension between Asian and African Americans, patterns of immigration have shifted. Stores once operated by recent Korean immigrants are now owned by strivers from South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The population of Baltimore has shrunk and its economy has contracted. Among merchants, there's ever-greater recognition that they and their customers are tied by a red thread, surviving or failing together. For decades, black and Asian advocacy groups have been trying to bridge differences between the communities. For example, the Baltimore-based Korean-American Grocers & Licensed Beverage Association of Maryland, founded in 1995, has worked to support its entrepreneurial members in their own attempts to address longstanding issues of neglect and abuse by Baltimore's police, while also encouraging them to build deeper ties with their constituents. A KAGRO-sponsored annual scholarship program has given hundreds of thousands of dollars in college grants to children growing up in the Baltimore neighborhoods their member retailers serve. These aren't the kind of stories you'll hear in the media. It's easier to focus on attention-grabbing anecdotes rather than the long, hard work of adjustment and accommodation going on within and around communities. Back in 1995, the Baltimore Sun profiled Soon Jae and Eun Ja Lee, owners of Lee's Food Market in the West Baltimore's Sandtown neighborhood -- the same part of the city that NPR called out as a locus of Asian-black tension. The story highlighted the Lees' openness to the community, their politeness and care for their customers and their outstanding generosity, which includes both free snacks to schoolchildren and the distribution of tens of thousands of free food baskets to needy local families each year. I spoke with Eun Ja Lee, calling her without warning to check on the status of the Lees' four-decade-old business after the violence of Monday and Tuesday. Were they open? Were they safe? \"Oh, of course we're open, we're always open!\" said Mrs. Lee, warmly and brightly. \"This week, many customers came in and said to me 'Mrs. Lee, don't worry you are part of our community, you are our family. We will make sure you are OK -- just stay open!' We love it. We love it.\" And yet, no one has come and interviewed her at their untouched and fully operational family market, nor have they talked with her customers, stoutly loyal after 37 years of patronage. Reinforcing the tired narrative of black-Asian interracial tension generates heat, but not light. There's a far more complex and nuanced relationship between these two urban populations, one that is in an ongoing state of evolution -- and it deserves to be told, not buried under cliches and clickbait.",

        "article": "Bayern Munich will be without midfielders Bastian Schweinsteiger and Franck Ribery when they travel to Porto for Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg. Frenchman Ribery is not yet fully fit following a five-week absence with an ankle injury while Schweinsteiger has had a virus for the past few days. 'Bastian and Franck will not be with us against Porto. That is bitter,' sports director Matthias Sammer said on Monday as the problems started to pile up for the treble-chasing Bavarians. Bayern boss Pep Guardiola has a long injury list to contend with as he aims for domestic and European glory. Bastian Schweinsteiger lies injured on the pitch during Bayern's 1-0 win against Borussia Dortmund on April 4. Medhi Benatia, David Alaba, Javi Martinez and Arjen Robben had already been sidelined by injuries. Jerome Boateng, who was rested for Saturday's 3-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt due to a minor muscle problem, is back in the squad. 'Those who are with us have our full trust,' Sammer told reporters ahead of the team's departure for Portugal later on Monday. 'The team is hungry.' Bayern are 10 points clear at the top of the Bundesliga and are also through to the German Cup semi-finals.

        "article": "Irish betting company Paddy Power is backtracking after tweeting that \"Newcastle have suffered more Kop beatings over the last 20 years than an unarmed African-American male.\" The tweet, a pun on the name of the famous home end at Liverpool Football Club, alluded to recent controversial incidents in the United States in which unarmed African-American men have been killed by police. Paddy Power -- well-known for its use of publicity stunts -- used it to link to a piece showing statistics for games between Liverpool and Newcastle United ahead of their English Premier League match on Monday. A Paddy Power spokesman told CNN before Liverpool's 2-0 victory at Anfield: \"It was a joke, and no offense was meant.\" The tweet has since been deleted, but its removal -- along with the statement -- did little to placate social media users who condemned the organization, with some calling for the person who wrote the tweet to be sacked. In January, Paddy Power attracted headlines after backing David Ginola's failed candidacy for the presidency of world football's governing body. The former Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham player could not persuade enough FIFA football associations to back his bid. He needed five to have any chance of unseating Sepp Blatter. Paddy Power started the funding for the candidacy, but its penchant for publicity stunts quickly led many people to dismiss Ginola's bid as another attempt to grab headlines. Paddy Power, the son of one the company's founders and its marketing spokesman, explained: \"We've been known for some mischievous activity around the world. This is not that. This is for real.\" Last year, the company generated anger when it promised \"money back if he walks\" in relation to the trial of disgraced South African Paralympian Oscar Pistorius. Monday's win put Liverpool fifth in the table, four points behind defending champion Manchester City, which holds England's final European Champions League qualification spot with six games left to play this season. Young England forward Raheem Sterling, who has turned down a new contract, scored a fine solo goal in the first half, and midfielder Joe Allen's 70th-minute strike condemned 13th-placed Newcastle to a fifth successive league defeat. Newcastle, which had France international midfielder Moussa Sissoko sent off in the 83rd minute, has not won at Anfield since a 1-0 victory in the League Cup in November 1995.",

        "article": "On Thursday, NPR -- headquartered in Washington, just 40 miles away from Baltimore -- ran its latest update on the urban turmoil that has erupted in the wake of the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray because of still-unexplained spinal injuries that occurred while he was under police custody. Unfortunately, while it was a freshly produced segment, it was hardly a new story. Titled \"Baltimore Unrest Reveals Tensions Between African-Americans And Asians,\" the five-minute piece is urgently introduced with the promise that it will reveal \"what's really happening in the more troubled neighborhoods of this majority black city,\" going on state that a key ingredient of the unrest was African-Americans \"targeting Asian-owned businesses for destruction.\" A similar claim was made after Ferguson's uprising in August of last year. Indeed, it has been a toxic feature of the coverage of many episodes of mass metropolitan violence since the late 1980s, the era during which the trope of widespread hostility between Asian and black communities first took root in the media consciousness. Yes, interethnic tensions continue to exist, though they are hardly limited to Asians and blacks. And yes, this has resulted in troubling incidents and tragedies on both sides. But while reports say that during the chaotic social breakdowns of the past year, black-owned businesses were mostly protected during bouts of violence, there's little evidence to suggest a pattern in which Asian businesses have been actively targeted out of racial animus. Instead, it seems as if Asian-owned stores have experienced damage partly because they make up a portion of establishments operating in the most economically vulnerable and socially volatile of neighborhoods. In other words, they were collateral damage, along with other stores in the vicinity of riots. So it's time to call this persistent meme what it is: A misleading, hyperbolic and dangerous distraction, one that shifts blame away from the real issues. As Jennifer Lee, sociology professor at University of California, Irvine, and author of the 2002 book \"Civility in the City: Blacks, Jews and Koreans in Urban America,\" notes, \"the mainstream media continues to pit minority groups against one another to draw attention from larger structural problems that plague poor, disadvantaged communities. By directing our attention to interminority conflict, it directs blame away from the structures that perpetuate gross inequality and toward individual problems.\" Let's be honest. There were then -- and still are -- legitimate issues that exist between immigrant storeowners and the largely African American customers they serve that are rooted in extensive cultural differences. There's no denying that friction exists in the daily transaction between embattled communities trying hard to coexist under economic and social pressures. For example, in 1993, the robbery and shooting of Joel Lee, a 21-year-old Korean American at Towson State University, and the subsequent acquittal of his killer, was a point of contention between the Korean and African American communities. But things are different now. Decades after the height of media-inflamed tension between Asian and African Americans, patterns of immigration have shifted. Stores once operated by recent Korean immigrants are now owned by strivers from South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The population of Baltimore has shrunk and its economy has contracted. Among merchants, there's ever-greater recognition that they and their customers are tied by a red thread, surviving or failing together. For decades, black and Asian advocacy groups have been trying to bridge differences between the communities. For example, the Baltimore-based Korean-American Grocers & Licensed Beverage Association of Maryland, founded in 1995, has worked to support its entrepreneurial members in their own attempts to address longstanding issues of neglect and abuse by Baltimore's police, while also encouraging them to build deeper ties with their constituents. A KAGRO-sponsored annual scholarship program has given hundreds of thousands of dollars in college grants to children growing up in the Baltimore neighborhoods their member retailers serve. These aren't the kind of stories you'll hear in the media. It's easier to focus on attention-grabbing anecdotes rather than the long, hard work of adjustment and accommodation going on within and around communities. Back in 1995, the Baltimore Sun profiled Soon Jae and Eun Ja Lee, owners of Lee's Food Market in the West Baltimore's Sandtown neighborhood -- the same part of the city that NPR called out as a locus of Asian-black tension. The story highlighted the Lees' openness to the community, their politeness and care for their customers and their outstanding generosity, which includes both free snacks to schoolchildren and the distribution of tens of thousands of free food baskets to needy local families each year. I spoke with Eun Ja Lee, calling her without warning to check on the status of the Lees' four-decade-old business after the violence of Monday and Tuesday. Were they open? Were they safe? \"Oh, of course we're open, we're always open!\" said Mrs. Lee, warmly and brightly. \"This week, many customers came in and said to me 'Mrs. Lee, don't worry you are part of our community, you are our family. We will make sure you are OK -- just stay open!' We love it. We love it.\" And yet, no one has come and interviewed her at their untouched and fully operational family market, nor have they talked with her customers, stoutly loyal after 37 years of patronage. Reinforcing the tired narrative of black-Asian interracial tension generates heat, but not light. There's a far more complex and nuanced relationship between these two urban populations, one that is in an ongoing state of evolution -- and it deserves to be told, not buried under cliches and clickbait.",

        "article": "It was another momentous night in Barcelona's proud European history, Neymar and Luis Suarez rampaging through Paris Saint-Germain's defence to put one foot in the Champions League semi-finals. And Barcelona's second of the night, in the 67th minute when Suarez stormed through, nutmegged David Luiz and finished, was their 400th goal in the competition. The landmark has been achieved in 202 matches since 1992 when the European Champions Clubs' Cup became the modern Champions League we know and love. The two goals scored by Luis Suarez against PSG took Barcelona past 400 Champions League goals. Barcelona have reached the landmark in 202 Champions League matches since 1992. Barcelona won the quarter-final, first-leg match 3-1 to put themselves in control of the tie. Barcelona still have a little way to go before they catch Real Madrid's 436 Champions League goals. Table courtesy of Opta. However, Barcelona still have a some way to go to match the 436 goals scored in the competition by their great rivals Real Madrid. The Spanish giants are way out on top in the club scoring charts, with Bayern Munich coming in third with 349 goals and Manchester United fourth with 343. Over the Champions League years, Barcelona have found the net most against AC Milan (22), followed by Celtic and Chelsea on 18 apiece. They have scored 17 times against United, Arsenal and Bayer Leverkusen. And it will come as little surprise that Argentine superstar Lionel Messi is way out in front in the breakdown of Barcelona Champions League scorers with 75, the joint-most in the tournament with Cristiano Ronaldo. Brazilian star Rivaldo comes in second with 22 goals, followed by Patrick Kluivert (20), Luis Enrique (19) and Samuel Eto'o (16). To mark Barcelona passing 400 Champions League goals, we take a look at some of the highlights. Barcelona 4 Manchester United 0 (1994-95 group stage) A United side hampered by a limit on foreign players had the misfortune to encounter Johan Cruyff's Barcelona 'Dream Team' at the wrong time. . Hristo Stoichkov and Romario ran United's makeshift defence ragged in front of 114,000 fans, with the Bulgarian scoring twice and the Brazilian once before Albert Ferrer completed United's humiliation. Romario fires home Barcelona's second goal in their 1994 rout of Manchester United in the Nou Camp. Barcelona 5 Chelsea 1 (1999-2000 quarter-final, second leg) Leading 3-1 from the first leg at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea fancied their chances of getting through ahead of the return. . Rivaldo's deflected free-kick and Luis Figo's goal had erased the deficit by half-time, though Tore Andre Flo put Chelsea back in the box seat. . They were seven minutes from going through when Dani Garcia made it 3-1 and there was still time for Rivaldo to miss a penalty. Chelsea's defence crumbled in extra-time, another penalty, this time converted by Rivaldo, and a fifth from Patrick Kluivert carried Barcelona through. . Luis Figo curls the ball home during Barcelona's 5-1 win over Chelsea in 2000. Barcelona 2 Arsenal 1 (2006 final in Paris) The Champions League triumph that signalled the beginning of Barcelona's golden age. . They needed two goals in the last 14 minutes to overcome the stubborn resistance of Arsenal, who had been reduced to 10 men when Jens Lehmann brought down Samuel Eto'o just 18 minutes in. . The Gunners sensationally took the lead through Sol Campbell's thumping header eight minutes before half-time but couldn't hold out as Eto'o and Juliano Belletti sunk them late on. . Captain Carles Puyol lifts the trophy with Ronaldinho after Barcelona's 2006 win over Arsenal. Barcelona 4 Bayern Munich 0 (2008-09 quarter-final, first leg) Pep Guardiola's star-studded team showed their Champions League-winning potential with this demolition of Bayern in which all four goals came before half-time. In no mood to hang around, Lionel Messi opened the scoring after nine minutes and Eto'o added another three minutes later. A second from Messi and another from Thierry Henry essentially settled the two-legged contest before half-time. Thierry Henry salutes Samuel Eto'o after rounding off Barcelona's 4-0 rout of Bayern Munich in 2009. Barcelona 2 Manchester United 0 (2009 final in Rome) Sir Alex Ferguson's team were going for their second Champions League triumph in a row and had beaten Barcelona in the 2008 semi-finals. . Guardiola's team had other ideas and exacted revenge thanks to a 10th-minute opener from Eto'o and Messi's clincher 20 minutes from time. It was Barcelona's midfield partnership of Xavi and Andres Iniesta that ran the game. . Lionel Messi (left) and Andres Iniesta parade the European Cup after the 2009 win over Manchester United. Barcelona 4 Arsenal 1 (2009-10 quarter-final, second leg) One of Messi's finest performances as the maestro scored four times to demolish Arsenal's Champions League hopes. . With the last-eight tie locked at 2-2 from the first leg, the Nou Camp was stunned when Nicklas Bendtner scored a precious away goal on 18 minutes. From then on, it was a one-man show. . Messi had equalised within three minutes and had Barcelona in control with another couple before the break, including a sumptuous lob. A fourth late on made it an emphatic win. Messi scored four times as Barcelona demolished Arsenal in a 2010 quarter-final . Real Madrid 0 Barcelona 2 (2010-11 Semi-final, first leg) This Clasico semi-final in 2011 was a dream come true for all football fans and it was Messi and Barcelona that kept their cool as tempers frayed. . Real hothead Pepe was sent off in the 61st minute and boss Jose Mourinho sent to the Bernabeu stands shortly afterwards for protesting. Cue Messi to seize control, turning home Ibrahim Afellay's cross and then setting off on a 30-yard run to score the second. . Barcelona pile on Messi after his goal in the Bernabeu semi-final back in 2011. Barcelona 3 Manchester United 1 (2011 final at Wembley) Barcelona were unquestionably the best team in Europe at this time and another final triumph over United confirmed this. At Wembley, Pedro gave them the lead in the 27th minute, only for Wayne Rooney to level shortly afterwards. But Barca were by far the better team, dominating possession, and it came as little surprise when Messi fired home at the start of the second half. David Villa made sure 20 minutes from time as Barca claimed a third European Cup in five years. . Pep Guardiola is thrown into the air by Barcelona after their 2011 final win over Manchester United. Barcelona 7 Bayer Leverkusen 1 (2011-12 last 16, second leg) Messi raised his game to even greater heights, becoming the first player to score five goals in a Champions League fixture in this seven-goal drubbing of Bayer Leverkusen. . Leading 3-1 from the first leg in Germany, there was little pressure on Barca and their domination was exemplified by their 865 passes in the game to the German side's 217. . Many of them found their way to Messi, who scored twice before half-time and added another three after. Messi slots home his fourth goal in Barcelona's 7-1 demolition of Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. Manchester City 0 Barcelona 2 (2013-14 last 16, first leg) City desperately wanted to make a statement on the European stage but Barcelona had other ideas in this clinical away performance. . The decisive moment came in the 54th minute when Messi was fouled by Martin Demichelis, who was sent off. Messi dusted himself down to convert the penalty and Dani Alves delivered a late second after swapping passes with Neymar. Messi converts from the penalty spot in Barcelona's 2-0 win at Manchester City last season. 22 goals - AC Milan. 18 - Celtic, Chelsea. 17 - Manchester United, Bayer Leverkusen, Arsenal. 16 - Panathinaikos, Lyon. 14 - Galatasaray. 13 - Shakhtar Donetsk, Spartak Moscow, Paris Saint-Germain. 10 - Ajax, Stutgart. 9 - Porto, BATE Borisov. 8 - Sporting Lisbon, Werder Bremen, Newcastle United . 75 - Lionel Messi. 22 - Rivaldo. 20 - Patrick Kluivert. 19 - Luis Enrique. 16 - Samuel Eto'o. 15 - Pedro. 14 - Ronaldinho. 11 - Javier Saviola, Xavi. 10 - Andres Iniesta. 8 - Neymar, Thierry Henry, Hristo Stoichkov, David Villa. 7 - Luis Figo, Gerard Pique, own goals.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .",

They can provide an inexpensive way to complete a range of household tasks, from being transformed into temporary dish covers and snack bowls, to cleaning varnish off your fingernails when you've run out of cotton wool. . Scroll down for video . They are usually used to trap coffee grounds when brewing filter coffee at home but paper filters have a myriad of other household uses . Here FEMAIL has rounded up the 20 unusual things you can do with coffee filter papers   . 1. As a makeshift lid . Worry not if your only microwave-friendly bowl has lost its lid. Simply turn a filter paper upside down and place it over the dish when you pop it into the microwave. 2. To strain juices. Use them as filters when you are straining freshly squeezed citrus fruit juices such as lemon or lime juice. Or a bottle of wine which has bits of cork in it. . 3. As cupcake holders. Forgotten to buy baking tin liners for when you\u2019re making cupcakes? Line your cupcake tin with filter paper and start to pour your cake batter in. . Lint-free and tear-resistant filter paper cones can be life-savers in many other situations, too. 4. Disposable bowls for parties . Use them as disposable snack bowls for nuts, popcorn, and mini pretzels when you\u2019re throwing a party where you don\u2019t want to put out plates. 5. To prevent rust . Place a filter on top of a cast iron pan so that it soaks up all residue moisture, preventing any rust from occurring. . 6. Vegetable crisper. Keep celery crispy by storing them with a coffee filter, which are far more absorbent than kitchen roll, and will absorb moisture from the vegetables. 7. Butter cake tins . The next time you\u2019re oiling a baking pan or cake tin, spread your butter or oil with a coffee filter instead of using a brush or a paper towel. 8. Stop messy ice-cream spillage. Wrap a filter around the centre of an ice-cream cone to keep little hands clean from ice-cream mess. 9. To hold your bouquet garni. Use it as a bouquet garni holder the next time you\u2019re making soup or stews. Simply pop in the herbs you want into the bottom of the filter and tie with twine or string before popping it into your pot. Wrap a piece of coffee filter paper around your sticks of celery to keep them from going soggy and limp. A few drops of essential oils onto a couple of filter papers when drying will keep them smelling fresh. 10. Quick and easy tea strainer . Looking to brew a cuppa with fresh leaves but misplaced your strainer? Measure a teaspoon of leaves, and as with the bouquet garni, place leaves at the bottom before tieing the top ends of with string. Then put your DIY teabag at the bottom of the mug and top with hot water. 11. When weighing wet foods. Weigh chopped wet foods without making a mess on your kitchen scales. Just place the ingredients in a filter on the scale. . 12. Instead of cotton wool. Need to remove nail polish but you\u2019ve run out of cotton wool? Simply dip them in your nail varnish remover and start gently scrubbing. . 13. Absorb nasty smells . Make your own odour-eaters by placing a heaped teaspoon of baking powder at the bottom of each filter, then gathering it up the top ends together and tying it up with string. Place in stinky shoes. 14. Keep your face oil-free. They make inexpensive and absorbent face blotters.  . Place tea leaves and herbs in the middle of your filter cone and tie it up with string before brewing . Add a dab of shoe polish to a paper filter and use it to shine your shoes . 15. Keep delicate crockery safe. Moving house and in possession of delicate crockery which absolutely cannot break? Simply place coffee filters between your china when packing to protect them. 16. Keep clothes smelling fresh . Put a few drops of your favourite essential oil onto a couple of filter papers before chucking them in the tumble drier when you\u2019re drying your clothes for an inexpensive way to scent them. 17. Pot plants without soil spillage. When repotting a plant from the nursery, pop a coffee filter at the bottom of the new pot so that soil doesn\u2019t leak out on the floor. This is especially useful for house plants. 18. Composting . Place a filter at the bottom of your kitchen compost pot so that there are no leakages or spills. Simply empty the whole lot out the next time you are adding to your compost pile. 19. Polish your shoes. Coffee filters are perfect for polishing leather shoes as they are lint-free and so won\u2019t leave unsightly streak marks on your shoes. Apply a dab of your favourite shoe polish on the filter and use it as an applicator. 20. Clean mirrors and glass . As they are lint-free coffee filters can be used to polish glass, and clean mirrors. .  .",

        "article": "According to an outside review by Columbia Journalism School professors, \"(a)n institutional failure at Rolling Stone resulted in a deeply flawed article about a purported gang rape at the University of Virginia.\" The Columbia team concluded that \"The failure encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking.\" Hardly a ringing endorsement of the editorial process at the publication. The magazine's managing editor, Will Dana, wrote, \"We would like to apologize to our readers and to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout, including members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and UVA administrators and students.\" Brian Stelter: Fraternity to 'pursue all available legal action' The next question is:. Can UVA, Phi Kappa Psi or any of the other fraternities on campus sue for defamation? The Virginia Supreme Court said in Jordan v. Kollman that \"the elements of libel are (1) publication of (2) an actionable statement with (3) the requisite intent.\" \"Actionable\" means the statement must be both false and defamatory. Of course, the law of defamation must be balanced against the freedom of speech protected under not only the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, but also the Virginia Constitution. True statements cannot be defamatory. Neither can pure statements of opinion, because they theoretically cannot be either true or false. But the Rolling Stone article certainly purported to be fact, and it apparently is not exactly what the law considers \"true.\" The individual members of the fraternity will likely be considered private individuals, and not public figures; the latter have a harder time proving defamation. A private person suing for defamation must establish that the defendant has published a false factual statement that is about the person and that it also harms the person's reputation. The private plaintiff also must show that the defendant knew that the statement was false, or believed it was true but lacked a reasonable basis, or acted negligently in checking the facts. At first blush, that sounds like it fits perfectly, right? The Columbia report may go a long way toward establishing at least a modicum of the required intent. But that's only half the battle. There are strict rules about who can be a plaintiff in a defamation action like this. The identity of the aspiring plaintiff matters. First, let's eliminate UVA. The university is a public university, and therefore it is a governmental entity. The Supreme Court has been clear on the issue of libelous statements about the government: The government cannot sue for defamation. There is no such cause of action in American jurisprudence. Now the fraternities, starting with Phi Kappa Psi. A fraternity is not an individual, but a group. A plaintiff in a defamation case must show that the statements were \"of or concerning\" the plaintiff. It sounds obvious, but if you're going to say a statement hurt you, you have to prove the statement actually was about you to begin with. When the statements are about a group without naming an individual, it's hard to say the statement is \"concerning\" the individual -- and groups generally cannot sue.  For example, you can be sued if you call a specific lawyer a thief, but that same person cannot sue you if you simply call all lawyers thieves. Defamatory statements about a group are therefore not actionable by the group's individual members, for the most part. Like all rules, however, there are exceptions. If the defamatory language is about \"a comparatively small group of persons and the defamatory part is easily imputed against all members of the small group, an individual member may sue.\" If I said, \"The 1980 Philadelphia Phillies infielders were a bunch of criminals\" (they weren't),  the individual players could sue, because that mean statement is clearly about certain persons -- if I said that -- which I didn't. Phi Kappa Psi would likely argue that the \"small group\" exception fits it perfectly: Even if the individual members were not identified by name, the defamatory story has been imputed directly to individual members, who have suffered by their association with the group. On the other hand, Rolling Stone's lawyers would likely argue that the group is so large and fluid (after all, the membership changes somewhat every year), that even though the fraternity's reputation is tarnished, the members have suffered no individualized injury. As for the other fraternities on campus but not implicated in the story, that's likely a group that moves from the small category to large, and the members of Greek life generally will have a harder time bringing a lawsuit. Lawyers will tell you that a libel suit is one of those things that citizens often threaten each other with on Facebook, but that such cases are rarely actually filed. That's because a plaintiff usually has to show some kind of financial harm. So if your Aunt Edna calls you a loser on Twitter, you're going to have to spend money on an expert to explain to a jury how that actually damaged you financially. And since most of the people who waste time threatening each other with defamation suits  on Facebook live in their moms' basements and are \"between jobs,\" these are not the kind of people who have money or reputation to damage in the first place. The UVA situation is not your run-of-the-mill defamation case. The university won't be able to sue, but if the members of the fraternity can get past some of the preliminary hurdles of a defamation claim, and they can make a tangible case for damages, then this could be one of those rare successful defamation cases.",

        "article": "Former QPR manager Harry Redknapp feels he still has plenty to offer football but only at the right club, having turned down a 'mind-blowing' offer to coach abroad. The 68-year-old handed in his resignation at Loftus Road in February, citing knee problems behind the decision to leave the Barclays Premier League strugglers, although he later claimed 'people with their own agendas' had a hand in his departure and described the situation at the west London club as 'a bit of a soap opera'. Redknapp will return to the dugout on Sunday, May 31 when he leads a star-studded Men United XI against Leyton Orient Legends, as O's youth coach and Prostate Cancer UK ambassador Errol McKellar hosts a charity football match at The Matchroom Stadium. Harry Redknapp (right) says he would consider a return to management as long as it's at the right club. Redknapp was speaking at the announcement of a Men United XI vs Leyton Orient Legends charity match. The well-travelled former West Ham, Bournemouth, Portsmouth, Southampton and Tottenham manager, Redknapp feels 'fit as a fiddle' again following knee surgery and would relish another crack at a full-time job, but only under certain circumstances. 'It is difficult to know whether you want to go back in again, but if the right offer came along for the right job then I would consider it, because I do love the game and certainly do miss it,' Redknapp said. 'But unless it was the right job I would not bother. It has got to be something which I really wanted to do. 'It would not be a case of the money. I had an offer earlier this week to go and work abroad where the money was incredible, a mind-blowing offer, but at the moment it did not interest me. 'I have my wife here, my grandkids and everything else, so it has got to be something I wanted to do. Redknapp resigned as Queens Park Rangers manager with immediate effect in February. Redknapp left the Loftus Road outfit citing knee problems behind his decision two months ago. The 68-year-old left Queens Park Rangers with the club 19th in the Premier League table at the time. 'I don't have to work any more if I don't want to at my age, but I feel fit as a fiddle and if I could go into a club somewhere, maybe try to get them up from the Championship or somewhere in the Premier League, then I might be interested. 'I could even work with a younger coach to help them and they could then take over as manager in a year or two, to help build the club up; that is something which would interest me but we will have to wait and see what comes along.' While it remains to be seen what chapter will be next in Redknapp's colourful management career, he hopes to see one of his former clubs Bournemouth go on to secure promotion to the top flight for the first time, with the Cherries currently top of the Sky Bet Championship heading into the final three matches. He said: 'The job which Eddie (Howe) has done is second to none. He has been amazing, taking things on to another level. . Redknapp is full of praise for the job current Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has done at the club. The Cherries sit top of the Championship with three games of the season remaining. 'I can't see them not going up because they are the best team in the league, playing the best football in the division and are a pleasure to watch. They never change their philosophy home or away and are brilliant to watch. 'The owner has come in, Max (Demin) the Russian, and has put his money in, helped take the club on. So you don't know (what they could do after promotion) but I would just like to see them get there.' Redknapp lost close friend and former West Ham team-mate John Bond to prostate cancer and is backing the Men United campaign to help raise awareness of the disease, which is the most common cancer in men with more than 10,000 deaths each year. He said: 'Prostate Cancer is something which can affect any family at any time so it is important that people come out to support this cause. 'We are all scared that if the doctor tells you that you have something wrong, but if you get there early enough it can be cured - you can't let it just go.' Redknapp  lost close friend and former West Ham team-mate John Bond to prostate cancer. People are being urged to search Men United and do something great with their mates via prostatecanceruk.org/menunited. Tickets for the Men United XI match are priced at \u00a310 adults and \u00a35 concessions, and are available from www.lofcdirect.co.uk.",

        "article": "Derby County season ticket holders from the 2010-11 campaign might struggle to believe it but Alberto Bueno prepares to face his former club Real Madrid on Wednesday as the highest-scoring Spanish-national in La Liga with a big money move to Porto waiting for him at the end of the season. Bueno played for Derby on loan five years ago, but with just five goals in 29 games he looked anything like Champions League material. After returning to Valladolid he moved to Rayo Vallecano and at the club with one of the lowest budgets in Spanish football he has had the season of his life. Now Champions League quarter-finalists Porto, coached by Spaniard Julen Lopetegui, are ready to poach him. Alberto Bueno (left) in action for Derby against Norwich during his unsuccessful spell with the club. Bueno celebrates scoring for Real Madrid against Real Union in November 2008. Bueno has scored 17 goals for Rayo Vallecano this season and could soon move to Porto. AGE: 27. CLUBS (League record only) Real Madrid (2006-09): 97 apps, 22 goals. Real Madrid (2008-09): 3 apps, 0 goals. Valladolid (2009-13): 85 apps, 13 goals. Derby (loan, 2010-11): 29 apps, 5 goals. Rayo Vallecano (2013-) 65 apps, 26 goals . Seventeen of the 35 goals that Rayo have scored this season have come from Bueno. He hit four in one game earlier this year against Levante and will be gunning for his old club on Wednesday night. Bueno came through at Real Madrid in the 2006-07 season when then manager Fabio Capello fast-tracked him from the C-team to train with David Beckham, Luis Figo and Raul. He eventually made his full debut in both La Liga and the Champions League two seasons later but like so many strikers from Real Madrid\u2019s youth system before him he was going to have to leave to really launch his career. Following in the footsteps of Alvaro Negredo and Roberto Soldado he left the club in 2009 signing for Valladolid from where he spent a season at Derby before ending up back in Spain. Negredo and Soldado both made it into the Spain squad after they succeeded away from Madrid and national team boss Vicente Del Bosque will be watching on Wednesday when Bueno goes up against Sergio Ramos as Rayo Vallecano look to take the scalp of Real Madrid in their rickety atmosphere-charged three-sided Vallecas stadium.  .",

        "article": "Divock Origi has revealed that the progress of Jordon Ibe at Liverpool this season has left him counting the days until he makes his Anfield bow. The Belgium striker was signed by Liverpool in a \u00a310million deal after impressing at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, before being loaned back to Lille for the 2014-15 season. But Origi has been following Liverpool's progress from across the English Channel and after seeing the rise of Ibe and Raheem Sterling, is eagerly anticipating working under Brendan Rodgers. Divock Origi said the progress of Liverpool's youngsters have heightened his excitement at joining the club . Origi referenced the progress of winger Jordon Ibe (left) as an example of youth players improving at the club. Origi added that he thinks the long-term progress of Raheem Sterling means he is joining the right club. 'When you see how the coach and the staff work with the young players - how Sterling, for example, has learned over the years and how Ibe is now integrating with the team, it is very interesting,' Origi told Liverpool's official website. 'It is very nice to have seen that this season. 'The manager is one of the reasons I came to Liverpool - he's someone who has proven he knows how to work with young players, knows how to develop young players and also lets them play.' Origi, who has scored seven times in Ligue 1 this season, believes that the backing of Liverpool's supporters will help him elevate his game. 'I'm somebody who when I feel loved, when I feel appreciated by the supporters, then I can give even more. It gives you a boost on the field. In Belgium it was this way, and I can see it at Liverpool.' Origi (second eight) earned a transfer to Liverpool after impressing for Belgium at the 2014 World Cup. Origi added that the challenges he has faced at Lille this season will make him a better player for Liverpool. Origi admits it has been a challenging season at Lille attempting balance the demands of the league with the Europa League but believes the experience he has gained means he will arrive at Liverpool a better player than this time last year. 'In a mental aspect, I've learnt a lot and I've learnt a lot about football and people looking at you,' Origi said. 'It's made me stronger and that's essential for me before coming to Liverpool.'",

        "article": "Tony Fernandes spoke of his despair after his Queens Park Rangers team twice threw away a lead against Aston Villa, with the Rangers chairman watching the scenes at Villa Park from afar on his iPhone. Christian Benteke's hat-trick earned a draw for Villa, with his last goal coming just seven minutes before full-time, and within five minutes of what had looked like a winner from Charlie Austin. Matt Phillips had earlier given QPR the lead in the first half but taking all three points wasn't to be for the relegation-threatened visitors and they had to settle for a point at Villa Park. Tony Fernandes spoke of his despair after his Queens Park Rangers team twice threw away a lead. Fernandes, Rangers chairman, was watching the 3-3 draw at Villa Park from his iPhone away from the game. Taking all three points wasn't to be for the relegation-threatened visitors and they had to settle for a point. And Fernandes, currently in Malaysia, spoke of his experience of a variety of emotions while watching the game from the other side of the world. 'It's a strange thing thus QPR love,' he tweeted. 'I went to bed at 1 in the morning. I got up exactly at 2.45 am. No alarm. My heart knew it's QPR time. . 'I watched the game on my iPhone all kinds of emotions. Despair, disappointment, joy, but most important pride. 4 points from two away games.' Fernandes revealed that Richard Dunne and Leroy Fer could return for Sunday's visit of Chelsea and that Yun Suk-young would also return after that game. The character of QPR's Clint Hill and Chris Ramsey were praised by their club's chairman on Twitter. Charlie Austin looked like he might have scored a late winner for QPR but Christian Benteke equalised. Clint Hill scored his first Barclays Premier League goal for Rangers' second, and Fernandes was delighted with the display of the veteran centre back, even if he did fail to get to grips with the prolific Benteke. He also reserved praise for manager Chris Ramsey. 'Clint hill typified our fighting spirit,' he posted. 'As I've always said players playing for the badge and Chris Ramsey what a pro.' Finally, Fernandes posted some cryptic tweets as to his own future at the club, perhaps hinting that he would be leaving. Hill had equalised in the second half after hosts Villa led 2-1 at the break courtesy of Benteke's two goals. Matt Phillips opened the scoring for Rangers but they found themselves pegged back by brilliant Benteke. Fernandes is also Global CEO of AirAsia, the airline that saw flight QZ8501 go missing late last year. 'It's been a tough three months since December 28th. Abuse, tragedy, close friends gone but I never stopped believing in all that we do,' Fernandes said. 'The decision on my future has been made. 6 games 18 points. Never stop believing rangers fans. Les also a hero. Never stop believing.' . QPR stay inside the relegation zone but moved up to 18th place with the draw. They face Chelsea at Loftus Road on Sunday in what is sure to be another occasion to play on supporters', and the owners', emotions. .",

        "article": "Ashley Young is desperate to avoid being part of the first United team to lose five successive Manchester derbies. United have more silverware in their trophy cabinet, but City have had the better of their local rivals during the last couple of years. Last November's 1-0 victory at the Etihad Stadium was the fourth successive derby win for City. The last time they achieved that feat was 60 years ago. Ashley Young (right) wants to avoid a fifth successive derby defeat by neighbours Manchester City. Ander Herrera celebrates scoring as United move above City for the first time this season. United have lost the last four derbies to City:. 8 April 2013         United 1-2 City. 22 Sept 2013       City 4-1 United. 25 March 2014    United 0-3 City. 2 Nov 2014          City 1-0 United. United have never lost five straight matches to their local rivals and Young wants to end City's dominance this weekend when the Blues come to Old Trafford. 'That's something you want to put right,' the United winger said when asked about City's recent dominance in this fixture. 'It will be another massive game.' Despite City's recent success in derbies, United go into the match as favourites after registering five straight league wins. That run has helped United move into third, one point ahead of City, who slipped to their third defeat in five games at Crystal Palace on Monday. The champions defeat by Crystal Palace was Manchester City's third loss in five games. Young thinks United have a good chance of defeating the Barclays Premier League champions if they maintain their current form. He said: 'We know it will be tough but as long as we can play the way we have shown, especially in the last few games, and add to that, it's going to be a great game and hopefully we will get the three points. 'We want to keep the momentum going and the positive play.' Finishing above City would represent a major coup for manager Louis van Gaal, especially after the way his team started the season. But, wary of the fact that seven matches remain, Young is not letting himself get too carried away despite United's recent upturn in form. Sergio Aguero (right) celebrates after scoring the winner in the last Manchester derby in November 2014. 'It would be nice (to finish above City) but we are just taking each game as it comes,' the 29-year-old said. 'It is obviously going to be another tough one against City next week but we will prepare as well as we can do as we always do.' Young's form has been key to United's recovery. The former Aston Villa midfielder has been so good recently that he has kept record signing Angel di Maria out of the United team. That has not been enough to get him back into the England squad though. Many tipped Young to earn an England recall after 19 months in the wilderness, but manager Roy Hodgson left him out of his squad to face Lithuania and Italy. Young is hoping his revival at Old Trafford can force him back into England reckoning. Young revealed Hodgson did not call him to explain his absence from the 24-man party when it was announced. 'There was no conversation (with Hodgson),' said Young, whose last England cap came against Ukraine in September 2013. 'Obviously I will always want to represent my country. I was a little bit disappointed not to be in the squad, but I have just got to make sure I am playing well here at United and hopefully I will get the call at some time soon.'  .",

After the game, Parish posed for a picture at Selhurst Park with Palace manager Alan Pardew, England boss Roy Hodgson and Bill Wyman - one of the original members of The Rolling Stones and avid Palace fan. Parish posted the picture on Instagram, writing: 'Great moment for me , AP, the England manager, one of the original @RollingStones @bill_wyman.' . Writing in his FourFourTwo column broadcaster Geoff Shreeves, who was also in the Palace boardroom after the game, said: '(Bill Wyman) has been an avid supporter for 68 years, having attended his first game aged 10. 'He can name virtually every player in that period, despite having spent 30 of those years in The Rolling Stones. 'Bill Wyman is not only a charming man but also somebody with a genuine passion for the game and its traditions. Wyman (back right) with fellow members of The Rolling Stones back in 1964. 'Given Bill\u2019s rock-star status, Steve Parish overlooked his normally strict rule that you must wear a shirt and tie in the boardroom.' Hodgson, who was a youth team player for Palace in the 1960s and is from the area, will have been casting his eye over a host of English players. Pardew used seven Englishmen including matchwinner Jason Puncheon, while England No 1 Joe Hart and utility man James Milner both played for City.

        "article": "Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League fixtures, as well as intriguing statistics from the Football League. . 1. Dick Advocaat might consider bringing in referee Anthony Taylor to give his players some lessons on keeping up with play. The official sprinted more than half the length of the field to be 10 yards from Yannick Bolasie when he completed his hat-trick for Crystal Palace in the 4-1 demolition of Sunderland. Top marks for him \u2013 but none at all for Lee Cattermole who was goal side of Bolasie before the breakaway began, yet way behind the official when the goal went in. Connor Wickham and Adam Johnson were also both stood nearer their own goal than the ref when James McArthur\u2019s clearance began the move, but nowhere to be seen when the ball hit the net. Yannick Bolasie raced past Lee Cattermole before scoring his hat-trick goal against Sunderland . Cattermole was goal side of Bolasie before the Crystal Palace winger went on to score his third goal. Referee Anthony Taylor sprinted past Sunderland midfielder Cattermole during Bolasie's impessive run. Bolasie starred in Crystal Palace's emphatic 4-1 win over Sunderland at the Stadium of Light . 2. Gary Cahill has responded to the challenge of fighting Kurt Zouma for his place in Chelsea\u2019s defence and looks to be winning the battle. When it got tough for the Premier League leaders at Loftus Road it was Cahill who responded best to ensure Cesc Fabregas\u2019 late striker was a winner. Cahill made 15 clearances \u2013 as many as the rest of Chelsea\u2019s back four put together \u2013 and won 13 of 15 duels for the ball. Gary Cahill has managed to win back his starting spot alongside John Terry after his brief absence . Chelsea starlet Kurt Zouma had deputised for Cahill during the England international's stint on the sidelines . 3. Arsene Wenger\u2019s decision to axe goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny after fining him for smoking in the showers at Southampton has proved a pivotal point of Arsenal\u2019s season. The 1-0 victory at Burnley was the sixth clean sheet the Gunners had kept in 12 Premier League games since David Ospina took over \u2013 one more than they\u2019d achieved in the previous 20. More important, Arsenal have won 11 of those matches to move from sixth in the table to second. Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina has kept six clean sheets since replacing Wojciech Szczesny . 4. Vincent Kompany\u2019s recovery from a hamstring injury was supposed to be the boost Manchester City needed towards the end of the season but instead has marked the collapse of their campaign. City were in the middle of a 14-game unbeaten run when their skipper came back to face title rivals Arsenal at the end of January \u2013 a game they lost 2-0. The 4-2 collapse at Old Trafford made it 14 matches since then, of which City have lost eight. Belgian star Kompany has missed only one of them \u2013 a 2-0 win over Leicester which saw one of only three clean sheets. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has struggled for form during the past few weeks . 5. West Brom\u2019s 'Jeff Astle day' provided a nostalgic trip back in time, with Albion\u2019s players wearing replica kit from the 1968 FA Cup final and shirts numbered from two to 11 (goalkeeper Boaz Myhill wore no number, like John Osborne back then). But there was one aspect that was completely out of keeping with the flashback to football\u2019s black and white days \u2013 every one of Albion\u2019s players wore coloured boots. Four red pairs, two orange, two white, one blue, one yellow \u2013 and captain Darren Fletcher\u2019s purplish pinky colour made up the modern footwear rainbow. West Brom captain Darren Fletcher wore multicoloured boots on 'Jeff Astle day' at The Hawthorns. 6. When Paul Lambert was sacked in early February, Aston Villa had scored just 15 goals in 28 matches in all competitions. It\u2019s taken Tim Sherwood just 10 games to overtake that total \u2013 Christian Benteke\u2019s winner at White Hart Lane was the 16th scored since his appointment. Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke has returned to form since Tim Sherwood's arrival at Villa Park. 7. James Ward-Prowse backed up manager Ronald Koeman\u2019s faith by tucking away the penalty against Hull that put Southampton on the path to a 2-0 win. Koeman had to shout orders from the bench to let the England youngster take the kick as Senegalese striker Sadio Mane picked up the ball to head for the spot first. You couldn\u2019t blame Mane for wanting to jump the queue \u2013 Ward-Prowse had never scored a Premier League goal in 68 previous appearances for the Saints, and none of his four England Under 21 strikes had come from the penalty spot. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman ensured James Ward-Prowse took penalty ahead of Sadio Mane . 8. Reading midfielder Jem Karacan has timed his return to fitness perfectly after 16 horrible months recovering from a cruciate knee ligament operation. The London-born product of the Royals\u2019 youth academy got through 73 minutes of the 0-0 draw with Blackburn in his first start for 16 months \u2013 just in time to be available for Saturday\u2019s FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal. He has a good chance of playing at Wembley after helping make the defence more solid. It was the first time Steve Clarke\u2019s side had kept a clean sheet in their last nine Championship games. Reading's Jem Karacan made his first start for 16 months against Blackburn on Saturday afternoon. 9. Taking 50 points is normally a guarantee of safety from relegation in League One \u2013 it\u2019s been enough to stay up for all but one of the last nine years (Gillingham had 50 but went down on goal difference in 2010) This season looks like being different, though, after Crewe\u2019s draw with Leyton Orient left both clubs plus Crawley on 47 points with four games still to play. That means sleepless nights for Crawley boss Dean Saunders who\u2019ll have bad memories of going down from the Championship with Wolves despite finishing on 51 points. Crawley Town are in danger of dropping down to League Two despite ascertaining 47 points in 41 games . 10. Plymouth midfielder Bobby Reid has the curious middle name of Armani \u2013 and he\u2019s certainly all the fashion when it comes to taking set-pieces. The 22-year-old is on his third loan of the season from Bristol City because Pilgrims boss John Sheridan admires his pinpoint accuracy with a dead ball. He showed why by setting up goals from both a corner and free-kick in a 2-1 win over Mansfield that put Plymouth back into the League Two play-off places. Plymouth midfielder Bobby Reid has taken League Two by storm since being loaned out by Bristol City.  .",

        "article": "Porto will need to hit top form to advance against five-times champions Bayern Munich on Tuesday despite holding a 3-1 first leg advantage in their Champions League quarter-final, coach Julen Lopetegui said on Monday. The Spaniard warned Bayern remained lethal even though they were missing several big names including Arjen Robben and David Alaba. 'We have to produce a great performance against one of the greatest teams in the history of Bayern,' Lopetegui, whose team are unbeaten in the competition this season, said. Ricardo Quaresma, who scored twice for Porto against Bayern Munich, smiles during training on Monday. Porto manager Julen Lopetegui believes his side will have to hit top form to progress against Bayern Munich. 'I am expecting a superb Bayern team, regardless of who they will end up playing and we are prepared for what will happen.' Bayern are also without Javi Martinez and Mehdi Benatia, while winger Franck Ribery looks set to miss the game with a nagging ankle injury. Germany captain Bastian Schweinsteiger returned to team training on Monday but he is also doubtful to start having been out for weeks with an ankle injury and a subsequent virus. Bayern are chasing a treble of titles and their fourth straight Champions League semi-final appearance. Twice winners Porto have not reached the last four since winning the trophy in 2004. Lopetegui had the luxury of resting nine players who had played against Bayern in their 1-0 league win over Academica on Saturday. 'We need to put everything we have planned into practice,' said the coach, who was a former Barcelona and Spain team mate of Bayern coach Pep Guardiola. Bruno Martins Indi (left) and Vincent Aboubakar (right) lead the way as the Porto squad warm up in Munich. Juan Quintero stretches for the ball at the Allianz Arena as Jackson Martinez (left) and Quaresma watch on. Porto will be without suspended Danilo and Alex Sandro but Jackson Martinez, who made his comeback from injury against Bayern and scored their third goal and Ricardo Quaresma, who scored the other two, are looking in fine form. They also have defender Ivan Marcano back from suspension. 'It will be a very difficult task but we will try to find simple answers,' Lopetegui said. 'We like the idea of playing Bayern, who are one of the best teams in the world. We cannot think about what could happen, we must focus on the game tomorrow and try to give the answer on the pitch,' he said.",
